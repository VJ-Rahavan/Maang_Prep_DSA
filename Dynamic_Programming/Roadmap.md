---

### 🔹 **Day 4: 2D DP - Grids**

- Navigating through matrices
- Base cases and direction of movement

**Practice (Medium):**

- [Unique Paths](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths/)
- [Minimum Path Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-path-sum/)
- [Unique Paths II](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths-ii/)

---

### 🔹 **Day 5: 2D DP - Strings**

- Subsequence-based DP
- String comparison logic

**Practice (Medium):**

- [Longest Common Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-subsequence/)
- [Edit Distance](https://leetcode.com/problems/edit-distance/) (Hard but doable)
- [Palindromic Substrings](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindromic-substrings/)

---

### 🔹 **Day 6: Practice Day / Revise**

- Mix of 1D and 2D DP
- Revisit wrong problems

---

### 🔹 **Day 7: Mock Interview (Timed)**

- Choose 3 problems from LeetCode’s “Top 100 DP”
- Practice under a timer

---

## 🗓️ **Week 2: Advanced DP + Patterns**

### 🔹 **Day 8: Knapsack Pattern**

- 0/1 Knapsack
- Subset Sum Variations

**Practice (Medium):**

- [Subset Sum](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/subset-sum-problem-dp-25/)
- [Target Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/target-sum/)
- [Last Stone Weight II](https://leetcode.com/problems/last-stone-weight-ii/)

---

### 🔹 **Day 9: Palindromes and Partitions**

- Cutting and minimizing partitions
- Using `dp[i][j]` for substrings

**Practice:**

- [Palindrome Partitioning II](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-partitioning-ii/)
- [Longest Palindromic Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-subsequence/)

---

### 🔹 **Day 10: DP on Subsequences**

- LIS (Longest Increasing Subsequence)
- Sequence transformations

**Practice:**

- [Longest Increasing Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/)
- [Minimum Number of Deletions to Make a String Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-deletions-to-make-a-string-palindrome/)

---

### 🔹 **Day 11: Bitmask + State Compression**

- Basic bitmask idea
- Small state-space optimizations

**Practice (Hard):**

- [Count All Valid Pickup and Delivery Options](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-all-valid-pickup-and-delivery-options/)
- [Tiling a Rectangle](https://leetcode.com/problems/tiling-a-rectangle-with-the-fewest-squares/)
- [Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) — Bitmask DP](https://leetcode.com/problems/salesman-problem/) _(or similar on GeeksforGeeks)_

---

### 🔹 **Day 12: Tree DP or Matrix DP**

- If you're prepping for competitive contests or advanced roles

**Practice:**

- [Diameter of N-Ary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-n-ary-tree/)
- [House Robber III (Tree DP)](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber-iii/)

---

### 🔹 **Day 13: Mixed Revisions**

- Review mistakes
- Solve random unseen DP problems

---

### 🔹 **Day 14: Final Mock (DP-focused)**

- Do a 90-min LeetCode contest (pick 4 medium-hard DP problems)
- Analyze performance

---

## 🎯 Final Tips:

- Don’t memorize; understand patterns.
- Write down transitions and base cases.
- Use a spreadsheet to track problem patterns (1D, 2D, Knapsack, Palindrome, etc.).
- Mock interviews simulate pressure and help spot weak points.
